🖥️ JSDesk: Interactive Desktop Environment Built with JavaScript

📄 Project DESCRİPTİON: 

This project is a desktop simulation that mimics the behavior of a real computer setup with interactive elements and multiple layers of functionality. The user interacts with the environment via a virtual hand and mouse, and experiences a seamless desktop simulation with additional creative touches.

🖥️ Main Features:

Dart Simulation:
On the right side of the desk, there are dart arrows. When the user clicks on them, the view transitions to simulate being behind the computer desk, and the dart game becomes playable. A button allows the user to return to the original view.

Light Control:
The switch on the wall turns the room light on and off. When the light is turned off while the computer is on, the room darkens but the computer screen remains visible — just like in real life.

Computer Power Button:
The computer can be turned on/off using the physical button on the computer case or through the virtual start menu on screen.

🖱️ Mouse Interaction:

Physical & Virtual Mouse Sync:
The user can drag the real-looking mouse on the table, and the computer screen’s cursor moves synchronously. This creates an immersive control experience.

Visual Selection Effect:
When the user clicks and drags with the mouse on the desktop, a rectangular selection box appears — just like in Windows — although no actual item selection is implemented. It’s purely visual.

🗂️ Desktop Applications:

Music Folder:
A folder on the desktop contains multiple music files. Users can play, stop, or switch tracks directly from the interface. Music can also play in the background while the dart game is being played.

Game Shortcut:
There is also a game on the desktop that can be launched and played from its icon.

Start Menu Simulation:
Clicking on the Windows icon in the bottom-left corner opens a menu window that mimics the Windows start menu. From there, users can also access the music folder and game, or shut down the computer.

📁 Resources:

All audio and image assets are linked using FileGarden URLs and dynamically loaded into the project.

🧠 Notes:

This is a simulation experience that prioritizes interaction and immersion.

There is no file management or drag-and-drop capability — all behaviors are scripted for visual and interactive effect.

📌FrameFlow: Frame-by-Frame Animation & Sound Synchronization in JavaScript

📄 Project Description (English):

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective frame-by-frame animation technique using p5.js. A sequence of individual images is displayed one after another in a timed loop, creating the illusion of motion—similar to traditional animation or stop-motion video.

🧩 Features:

Animal Animation:
The animation includes multiple animals: an eagle, a bird, and a horse. Their movements are shown using consecutive images displayed in a loop, simulating lifelike motion.

Timed Sound Effects:
Each animal is accompanied by synchronized sound effects triggered at specific frame intervals. This adds realism and rhythm to the animation.

Static Visual Element:
An image of a lion appears once and remains static on the screen throughout the animation. Unlike other animals, it does not loop, helping to balance the composition visually.

🖼️ Resources:

All image and audio files are externally hosted via FileGarden links and dynamically loaded into the program.

Assets are organized and referenced efficiently for optimal performance and loading time.

🎯 Purpose:

This project aims to experiment with traditional frame-by-frame animation techniques and sound timing within the p5.js framework, blending visuals and audio for a compelling animated sketch.

📁 Technologies Used:

JavaScript

p5.js

External media hosting (FileGarden)
