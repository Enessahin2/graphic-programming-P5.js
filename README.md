🖥️ JSDesk: Interactive Desktop Environment Built with JavaScript

📄 Project DESCRİPTİON: 

This project is a desktop simulation that mimics the behavior of a real computer setup with interactive elements and multiple layers of functionality. The user interacts with the environment via a virtual hand and mouse, and experiences a seamless desktop simulation with additional creative touches.

🖥️ Main Features:

Dart Simulation:
On the right side of the desk, there are dart arrows. When the user clicks on them, the view transitions to simulate being behind the computer desk, and the dart game becomes playable. A button allows the user to return to the original view.

Light Control:
The switch on the wall turns the room light on and off. When the light is turned off while the computer is on, the room darkens but the computer screen remains visible — just like in real life.

Computer Power Button:
The computer can be turned on/off using the physical button on the computer case or through the virtual start menu on screen.

🖱️ Mouse Interaction:

Physical & Virtual Mouse Sync:
The user can drag the real-looking mouse on the table, and the computer screen’s cursor moves synchronously. This creates an immersive control experience.

Visual Selection Effect:
When the user clicks and drags with the mouse on the desktop, a rectangular selection box appears — just like in Windows — although no actual item selection is implemented. It’s purely visual.

🗂️ Desktop Applications:

Music Folder:
A folder on the desktop contains multiple music files. Users can play, stop, or switch tracks directly from the interface. Music can also play in the background while the dart game is being played.

Game Shortcut:
There is also a game on the desktop that can be launched and played from its icon.

Start Menu Simulation:
Clicking on the Windows icon in the bottom-left corner opens a menu window that mimics the Windows start menu. From there, users can also access the music folder and game, or shut down the computer.

📁 Resources:

All audio and image assets are linked using FileGarden URLs and dynamically loaded into the project.

🧠 Notes:

This is a simulation experience that prioritizes interaction and immersion.

There is no file management or drag-and-drop capability — all behaviors are scripted for visual and interactive effect.

📌FrameFlow: Frame-by-Frame Animation & Sound Synchronization in JavaScript

📄 Project Description (English):

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective frame-by-frame animation technique using p5.js. A sequence of individual images is displayed one after another in a timed loop, creating the illusion of motion—similar to traditional animation or stop-motion video.

🧩 Features:

Animal Animation:
The animation includes multiple animals: an eagle, a bird, and a horse. Their movements are shown using consecutive images displayed in a loop, simulating lifelike motion.

Timed Sound Effects:
Each animal is accompanied by synchronized sound effects triggered at specific frame intervals. This adds realism and rhythm to the animation.

Static Visual Element:
An image of a lion appears once and remains static on the screen throughout the animation. Unlike other animals, it does not loop, helping to balance the composition visually.

🖼️ Resources:

All image and audio files are externally hosted via FileGarden links and dynamically loaded into the program.

Assets are organized and referenced efficiently for optimal performance and loading time.

🎯 Purpose:

This project aims to experiment with traditional frame-by-frame animation techniques and sound timing within the p5.js framework, blending visuals and audio for a compelling animated sketch.

📁 Technologies Used:

JavaScript

p5.js

External media hosting (FileGarden)

📌 OrbitSim: Interactive Planetary System Simulation with JavaScript

📄 Project Description:

This project simulates a miniature planetary system with interactive controls using JavaScript (likely with the p5.js library). A central sun is orbited by three planets, each with its own orbit radius and behavior. Users can interactively manipulate the speed, direction, and position of the planets and the sun.

🧩 Features:

Three Planets:
Numbered 1 to 3. Pressing keys 1, 2, or 3 selects a planet to control.

Dynamic Speed:
The selected planet’s orbital speed can be increased or decreased using the ↑ and ↓ arrow keys.

Orbit Direction:
Change the rotation direction of the selected planet using ← and → arrow keys.

Mouse-Driven Sun Movement:
Users can click and drag the sun to move the entire solar system. Planets follow the sun’s new position while maintaining their orbits.

Visual Feedback:
A status display shows the currently selected planet, the direction, motion state (e.g., active), and any changes made via the keyboard or mouse.

🎯 Purpose:

This simulation is intended to help users understand orbital mechanics in a simplified, gamified environment. It also offers a chance to explore vector movement, rotation systems, and user-driven transformations in a graphical context.

📁 Technologies Used:

JavaScript

p5.js or custom canvas rendering

📌 DropCircle: Dynamic Circle Generator with Physics Simulation

📄 Project Description :

DropCircle is an interactive simulation that allows users to create, customize, and drop circles influenced by gravity and horizontal momentum. The main circle can be resized and recolored, and users can drag it across the canvas. Smaller circles are spawned from its center with randomized colors and sizes, falling under gravity with lateral motion, eventually leaving the screen.

🧩 Features:

Draggable Main Circle:
Users can move the primary large circle across the screen with the mouse.

Customization:
The size and color of the main circle can be changed via an input field and color picker.

Dynamic Small Circles:
Clicking “Drop Small Circle” spawns a mini ball from the center of the main one, with randomized size, color, and velocity.

Gravity Simulation:
Dropped circles fall under a gravity-like force and drift sideways (left or right) to simulate real physics.

Clean Exit:
Once small circles exit the visible canvas, they are removed from simulation for performance.

🎯 Purpose:

This playful project combines UI control with basic physics simulation, useful for understanding forces like gravity and motion, while also offering creative visual outcomes.

📁 Technologies Used:

JavaScript

HTML/CSS

Canvas API (possibly p5.js or custom)
